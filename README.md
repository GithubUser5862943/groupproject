Description:
This is a simple calendar application designed to create a calendar with the ability to add event notes to the days selected and then save the data to a save file 
that can be reloaded later.

Key Features:
-Display area featuring calendar days
-Event text area for writing event notes
-Submit button for adding notes to selected days and saving changes
-Load button to load previously saved calendar data*

How to Use:

-On Startup-
After starting the app, simply click the "set/reset" button on the bottom right to set the month data for the view. It is important to set the base view
before attempting to load save data into the calendar as it requires the days to be set before reading data into the text fields.

-Saving Data-*
You must first select a day to edit in the event event window. You can select a day by clicking a non-empty day on a calendar that has been set.
Type whatever message you want in the event text area and then click the "submit" button to save changes to the file.

-Loading Data-*
If you have used the calendar before and have a save file, you may choose to load previous calendar data by simply clicking the "load calendar" 
button on the bottom right. *IMPORTANT: You must have SET the calendar FIRST to load data into the calendar*

*currently saving and loading has not currently been implemented yet
